    <p>What even is Net. Art? Sounds kind of geeky but Net art is just a trendy way of saying internet art or 'digital art' which is not far from the truth. However, what is the false part is more composed of 'network art' back in the 1970s where artists started exploring the appearance of the end-user system or "Minitel" as the French would say. The artist Eduardo Kac claims there's a common misconception when it breaks down to online culture. Everyone is obsessed with the internet, instead of seeing history is being made as it'll grow more in the future. Kac and other artists made poems or images on pre-internet communications as a medium.  For example, Lialina made an interactive poem called "My boyfriend came back from war" back in 1996 on Netscape. When regarding net art it is a time capsule showing art produced in the nineties or "web 1.0" when websites were static, and UI (User-Interface) was not a thing.</p>
